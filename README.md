As the name says,it's an app(game) that uses dice,for gambling. There are 2 games in this app. On opening the app,we see a roll-die game.The user gets five coins every time he rolls a six. User carries forward these total coins to the next state to play the next gambling game.Here the user can bet a certian amount of coins such that,if 4 die are rolled then either 2 or 3 or 4 will be same. Each of them has a reward and probability of winning/losing.
Known Bugs:
If a very large number is provided as input for the wager, the app is not able to parse it as an integer and gives an error - "Wager not set" instead of "Set a valid Wager".
Though i had changed the String name in the xml file and given it the value "Two or More" as was expected in the question,it was showing the previous name(Launch BlackJack). I figured out that it had to changed in the String.xml(night) file.
